PRESS TRUST OF INDIA TOKYO The Olympic rings are back in Tokyo Bay.  They were removed for maintenance four months ago shortly after the Olympics was postponed until next year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The rings arrived on Tuesday after a short cruise from nearby Yokohama and are positioned on a barge in the shadow on Tokyos Rainbow Bridge.  The rings  painted blue, black, red, green, and yellow  stand about 15 meters tall and are 33 meters in length.  The rings will be lighted at night and herald the coming of the Olympics, which are to open on July 23, 2021, followed by the Paralympics on Aug.  24.  The rings made their first appearance early in 2020, just a few months before the Olympics was postponed late in March.  Positive sign The reappearance of the rings is the latest sign that organisers and the International Olympic Committee are increasingly confident that 15,400 Olympic and Paralympic athletes can safely enter Japan during the pandemic
